		<h3>The Problem</h3>
		<p>MBHP wanted to present a more cohesive image by bringing their materials under a single visual identity system. With no in-house designers, little time and budget for redesigns, and a lot of existing collateral, the identity system we would create needed to be contemporary but also allow for a phased roll-out.</p>

		<h3>The Challenges</h3>
		<p>The identity system had to be easy to use for the small in-house marketing team, and the players on the ground: in the community and corporate board rooms.</p>

		<p>The system needed flexibility to support messaging for multiple demographics. For funders and decision-makers, a professional and contemporary feel, able to extend to handouts and Powerpoint presentations. For participants and internal audiences, the system needed to be approachable and visually consistent.</p>

		<p>And, as mentioned, it needed to incorporate existing visual conventions into a single system that would be a natural extension of the existing materials.</p>

		<h3>The Plan</h3>
		<p>Our primary goal: to expand MBHP’s visual identity, and create an easy-to-use guide and system of reusable elements.</p>

		<p>Here’s what we covered:</p>

	<div class="bg-wrapper bg-white grid">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Grid System</h3>
		<p>Without an underlying grid structure, colors, patterns, and typefaces can easily become  meaningless decoration. The grid outlines how to consistently structure design elements throughout all MBHP’s collateral.
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<!-- -->
	<div class="bg-wrapper bg-white typography">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Typography</h3>
		<p>Due to the lack of in-house design resources, choosing typefaces that improved the brand but were also readily available was a challenge. 
Fallback typefaces were also specified in the case of EXTREMELY limited resources and, of course, email.

		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Colors</h3>
		<p>MBHP’s existing red was in wide use, and would serve as a way to tie older material to the new visual identity. But they needed additional options to help customize designs while keeping a consistent look-and-feel; the palette was expanded to provide additional options for different audiences.

		<h3>Photos &amp; Patterns</h3>
		<p>Photos are an essential part of the identity, helping to convey the very human brand of MBHP. Photo treatments and various iconography-based patterns were introduced to create visual interest and allow for a multitude of visual combinations, all within the same visual style.
