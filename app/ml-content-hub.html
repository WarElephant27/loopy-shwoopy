		<p>The financial industry has changed a lot in the past decade. Merrill Lynch wanted to be sure their financial advisors had the most up-to-date information, and were using current financial planning methods.</p>

		<p class="txt-mid">But how to convince veterans in the field to change their ways? More importantly, how to convince FAs to wade into the swamp of information and gather enough to consider a new method?</p>

		</div>
		
	</div>

	<div class="bg-wrapper flex">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>Initial work included discovering what information was available on the intranet, what features and functionality (like search) were already available. We also began uncovering some of the barriers to entry that could hold advisors back. </p>

		<p>The intranet site was mainly accessible via search, meaning users had no way to browse content. Unless they knew exactly what they were looking for, information would be difficult to find. This meant a tedious experience that was unlikely to keep busy professionals engaged.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<!-- -->
	<div class="bg-wrapper flex">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>User Personas</h3>
		<p>We broke our user personas into three broad categories: Resistors, Uncertain, and Evangelist. These covered the main mindsets we hoped our users would journey through: initially resistant to change, but soon receptive but still uncertain of how to implement new tactics, and finally becoming proficient in new methodologies and helping to champion them to other advisors.
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<!-- -->
	<div class="bg-wrapper flex">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Brainstorming &amp; Concepting</h3>
		<p>Our goal was to not only make it easier to find the information, but to quickly explain to financial advisors why they should care. We began thinking about providing sets of articles on topics, or ‘course lists’ to help advisors get started. This still seemed too complex, so we ultimately decided to create ‘playbooks’ that would quickly engage advisors with a testimonial from a fellow advisor that explained the tactic and the benefit, all in one.
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<!-- -->
	<div class="bg-wrapper flex">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>Strategy</h3>
		<p>On first visit, our content hub would show them easy-to-skim articles giving quick, compelling reasons to consider new financial advisory methods. The site would then evolve as the user visited, offering more complex and focused articles depending on how often the user visited and what articles they clicked on.</p>

		<p>The relevant content for our hub would still be housed within the intranet main site, but we planned to present the hub as a ‘featured’ section. It would be better designed and would have custom created content for new users. This would allow us to create a single destination where we could serve up relevant content to advisors as our hub learned about their interests.
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper">
		<div class="content-wrapper">
		<h3>UI Design</h3>
		<p>Cleaner UI design was in order for the hub, but we were careful to include existing UI cues from the intranet site, like the bookmarking icon and functionality. We also used the UI design to distinguish between content housed in the hub, and article tiles that would bring the user deeper into the intranet. Overall, the minimalist design made the hub easy to skim and kept it from feeling overwhelming.</p>
