				<h1>Visual Identity Design</h1>
				<h2>for Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership (MBHP)</h2>

				<ul class="inline-ul">
				<li>expanded visual identity system</li>
				<li>brand graphic standards guide</li>
				<li>sample design work</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt-lrg">With their resources stretched and their days primarily spent focusing on the community and the greater good, the MBHP team had little time to spend worrying about the visual consistency of their many publications or internally-facing documents. They needed an approachable identity system that was not only easy to use for the small in-house marketing team, but for also for the players on the ground: in the community and corporate board rooms.</p>
			</div>

		<!-- Project Body -->
			<div class="proj-body">

				<div id="into-pt2" class="wrapper ph">
					<p class="txt-lrg">Our primary goal: to create an expanded visual identity, and an easy-to-use guide and system of reusable elements. Developing this system meant many things needed to be considered:</p>
				</div>

				<!-- The Overlap-->
				<div id="the-overlap" class="wrapper thingo">
					<div class="img">
						<img src="images/ph2.jpg">
					</div>

					<div class="col-half text">
						<h5>Audiences</h5>
						<p>The system needed to be flexible enough to support the messaging for many target demographics. For the funders and decision-makers, the system needed to be professional and contemporary, able to extend to handouts and powerpoint presentations. For the participants and internal audiences the system needed to have a consistent feel and approachability.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- Classic Stack-->
				<div id="classic-stack" class="wrapper thingo">
					<div class="img-center">
						<img src="images/ph2.jpg">
					</div>

					<div class="wrapper">
						<div class="text-wide">
						<h5>Grid System</h5>
						<p>Colors and patterns, and typefaces are just pretty (and occasionally meaningless) decorations without an underlying grid system to keep a consistent structure. The grid outlines how to quickly and efficiently structure design elements throughout all MBHP’s collateral, making it easy for those without prior experience to keep all documents visually homogenous.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>


				<!-- Full Width Image -->
				<div id="full-width-img" class="thingo">
					<div class="img-center">
						<img src="images/ph2.jpg">
					</div>

					<div class="wrapper text">
					<h5>Colors</h5>
					<p>MBHP’s  existing red ( #XXXXXX) worked and was in wide use. But they needed additional options to help customize designs while keeping a consistent look-and-feel; so the palette was expanded to provide additional options for different audiences. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="wrapper thingo">
					<div class="img">

					</div>

					<div class="col-half text">
					<h5>Typography</h5>
					<p>Due to the lack of in-house design resources, choosing typefaces that worked well and improved the brand, but were also readily available was a challenge. Fallback typefaces were also specified in the case of EXTREMELY limited resources and of course… email.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- -->
				<div class="wrapper thingo">
					<div class="img">
						<img src="images/ph2.jpg">
					</div>

					<div class="col-half text">
					<h5>Photos &amp; Patterns</h5>
					<p>With the grid system, palette, and typography in place, photography and pattern treatments needed to be considered and rules addressed. The photos are an essential part of the identity, helping to convey the very human brand of MBHP. Photo treatments and various iconography-based patterns were introduced to create visual interest but also allow for a multitude of visual combinations all within the same visual style. </p>
